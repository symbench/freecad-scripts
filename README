# FreeCAD scripts

## Usage with a docker container

- Clone the `freecad_scripts` repository and then run `docker build -t symbench:freecad-scripts .`.
- Run the container with `docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 symbench:freecad-scripts` and connect to it using your browser.
- Use `import freecad_scripts` to import the library and access its internals.

## Usage on your local machine

- Make sure that you have the `freecad-python3` (version 0.19) and `gmsh` packages installed. On ubuntu you would run the command `sudo apt-get install freecad-python3 gmsh`.
- Clone the `freecad_scripts` repository and install it with `pip3 install -e .`. This will allow you to update the code (e.g. with `git pull`) without reinstallation.
- Use `freecad-scripts --help` to list the supported subcommands.
