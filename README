# FreeCAD scripts

## Create a docker container

- Clone the `freecad_scripts` repository and then run `docker build -t symbench:freecad-scripts .`.

## Usage on your local machine

- Make sure that you have the `freecad-python3` and `gmsh` packages installed. On ubuntu you would run the command `sudo apt-get install freecad-python3 gmsh`.
- Clone the `freecad_scripts` repository and install it with `pip3 install -e .`. This will allow you to update the code (e.g. with `git pull`) without reinstallation.
